Hi Dominique,

By all means distribute the Julia version.

I did see the similar message that you sent to Stefan.
Please follow the suggestions of Stefan.
In particular, point to

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wild/dfo/benchmarking/ 

The code that Stefan and I wrote is different from the
original that I wrote with Liz Dolan.
Not sure which one you are making available, but
that is up to you and Stefan.

Cheers,

Jorge

ps. I did try to take a peek at the "note on performance profiles"
but my vpn to Chicago did not work tonight, so I could not get
a copy. If you have a copy handy, please send it to me.

Dear Jorge,

I’m working with the Julia language these days and I wrote what’s essentially a translation of your original Matlab code for performance and data profiles:

https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/BenchmarkProfiles.jl

I’d like to distribute it so users can install it easily but I’d like your blessing that it’s ok because I didn’t see any license with your code. I don’t want DOE to get antsy about it.

Thanks in advance.

I hope all is well.

Best,

Dominique
