Dominique, yes, of course I am ok with this. If it helps you, we can slap a BSD license (what we typically use) on the Matlab source.

Done! I added a link to your page and updated the link to the pitfalls paper. Thanks.

Is there any chance you would put a license on your original code? I’m not seeing any. I tentatively put the MIT “expat” license on my translation but I want to be sure we agree on things.

At least, I’d need a sentence from you saying that you’re ok with me distributing the Julia translation :-).

Cheers!

Salut Dominique,

Cool!
Sounds good, I'll add to the github link below to our main page,
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wild/dfo/benchmarking/
which I have been meaning to update (the old page
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/dfo/
should eventually just splash to the page above).

A small request: in either your readme or license, can you add a pointer to
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wild/dfo/benchmarking/
?
Just today I was in a meeting with the Argonne attorneys who reminded me we should do whatever we can so that an eventual user can see that this is open-source/pointed back to Argonne.

Hope all is well in Montreal,
Stefan

PS- You should update your link to the new version of Gould and Scott:

Bonjour Stefan,

I’m working with the Julia language these days and I wrote what’s essentially a translation of your Matlab code for performance and data profiles:

https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/BenchmarkProfiles.jl

I’d like to distribute it so users can install it easily but I’d like your blessing that it’s ok because I didn’t see any license with your code. I don’t want DOE to get all antsy about it. Feel free to forward the request to Jorge for his approval if necessary.

Hope all is well!

Cheers,
