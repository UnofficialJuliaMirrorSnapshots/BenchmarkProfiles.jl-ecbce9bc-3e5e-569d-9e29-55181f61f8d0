Dominique, yes, of course I am ok with this. If it helps you, we can slap a=
 BSD license (what we typically use) on the Matlab source.

Done! I added a link to your page and updated the link to the pitfalls pape=
r. Thanks.

Is there any chance you would put a license on your original code? I=92m no=
t seeing any. I tentatively put the MIT =93expat=94 license on my translati=
on but I want to be sure we agree on things.

At least, I=92d need a sentence from you saying that you=92re ok with me di=
stributing the Julia translation :-).

Cheers!
